  <h5 class="card-title"">XGBoost - eXtreme Gradient Boosting</h5>
  <p class="card-text"">XGB is one of the most popular and widely used machine learning algorithms due to its ability to handle large datasets and its ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance in many machine learning tasks such as classification and regression. XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance. This algorithm goes by lots of different names such as gradient boosting, multiple additive regression trees, stochastic gradient boosting or gradient boosting machines.</p>

  <p class="card-text">XGB combines many weak prediction models, usually decision trees, to create a more accurate predictor. It uses the gradient descent method to minimize the prediction error of each new model based on the previous ones. It combines several weak learners into strong learners.</p>

  <p class="card-text">Trading markers were computed for historical SNP stock data and plotted on a graph. Trading markers indicate on which days the stock price changed by a certain amount. The threshold set for marking a day as a trading marker on the graph was set to 0.2, meaning a 20% change from previous day.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">SVR</h5>
    <p class="card-text">SVR (Support Vector Regression) models combine the basics of linear regression with SVM by finding a hyperplane that fits the data points in continuous space. This allows SVRs to predict continuous outputs. SVRs are also able to make predictions from non-linear data by using kernels.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Here we can see the results of running SVR on a testing set of data. As you can see in the plot, many of the model's predictions are close to the actual values from the testing data and there is a low MSE (mean squared error) which shows high accuracy.</p>

    <h5 class = "card-title"> Decision Tree </h5>
      <p>Easy to understand and interpret, decision trees are structured just like what they're named after - a tree. These structures house internal nodes that represent an attribute, and each branch off of those represents a decision based on that attribute. The branches then lead to independent leaf nodes which represent a class label or numerical value. The only downside is that it is still subject to overfitting if not properly controlled, leading to poor generalization on unseen data.</p>

      <p>Below is a plot of Google's stock, with the "X" representing trade markers; trade markers mark the days when there was a 20% change from the day before. A decision tree was used for the classification of these trading markers. The accuracy data of the model is shown below the graph.</p>

      <p>From the confusion matrix above, you can see there are zero false positives and negatives, so the decision tree was fully accurate here</p>
